   1. I want to build an NFT marketplace but I want people to use the NFTs as tickets to get into concerts.
2. Target audience: Who is your app intended for? What demographic or user group are you targeting?
   1. As it is a marketplace the primary audience segment is two-fold. 1 wants to buy NFTs to then use those NFTs to get into concerts, and also potentially re-sell those NFTs. The other wants to sell mint and sell many of the same NFTs which will grant people access to their concert.

   3. Users need to be able to mint NFTs and dictate the number of NFTs they want to mint as well as the price.
   4. Use the polygon blockchain.
